        Ju Hong initially distanced himself from a lot of his friends in high school. But he soon realized that there
        were many others like him, as he wrote himself.</p>
    <p>
        “As I was learning more about all of this, I also was finding stories of other undocumented immigrants. And this
        was very inspiring for me because I had thought I was all alone. But here were these other people in the same
        situation and a lot of them were speaking up for changes in the law. When I first learned about my status and
        that I could face deportation, I didn’t want to talk to anyone about any of this. But when I saw other people
        risking their lives to share their testimony about their immigration status, I thought it was inspiring.”</p>

        There are many stories available here from 2013, showing how undocumented students rose above all challenges and
        even earned graduate degrees from California schools:

        “The application process was a difficult time for me because I was in removal proceedings. This means that
        while I was preparing applications and studying for the GRE, I was also reporting to immigration every
        couple months and attending court hearings, which would ultimately determine my deportation date.” <a

        “I was the first undocumented student in the program. In undergrad, I was one of the few undocumented
        students but I did not have the sense of being the only one facing these unique challenges. My entire cohort
        was doing paid assistantships and while I received an offer to do an assistantship I could not do it because
        of my status (pre-DACA). I did an internship my first year, while my second year I couldn’t do one because I
        couldn’t financially support myself to do a non-paid internship. Instead I worked somewhere else to get
        paid, but it was not related to my field.” <a
