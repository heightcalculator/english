        Even today, undocumented students across the country continue to struggle with resources limiting their ability to attend college and advance their education. They not only struggle to deal with a sense of identity but also struggle with coming up with the finances to attend school. These students are often hardworking and diligent and should not lose the right to advance their education just because of a label. As of 2021, the number of undocumented students in the United States remains stable at <a href="https://www.presidentsalliance.org/undocumented-students-in-us-higher-education/#:~:text=There%20are%20approximately%20408%2C000%20undocumented,remained%20roughly%20stable%20since%202021.">~400,000</a>. DACA recipients are still facing legal challenges and undocumented students caught up in court cases are actually ineligible to receive DACA assistance. <a href="https://ewa.org/educated-reporter/barriers-facing-undocumented-students-amid-daca-uncertainty ">Read More</a></p>

        There are many resources online such as <a href="https://mydocumentedlife.org/">My Documented Life</a>, <a href="https://defineamerican.com/">Define American</a>, and <a href="https://www.phdreamers.org/">PHDreamers</a> where anyone can listen to immigrant stories, but the first link is specific to undocumented students only. The first website contains up-to-date information about DACA and even has a monthly newsletter. This website is probably the best resource for undocumented students themselves but also includes how one can get involved for any interested student activists.

        Ju Hongâ€™s blog is not publicly available, but his LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juhong89/">here</a> and could potentially serve as a way to contact him and ask him about his story being a DACA and DREAM Act recipient. </p>

        Finally, <a href="https://unitedwedream.org/">United We Dream</a> is a great source for those who wish to advocate and fight for the fair treatment of immigrants in the US. They have many resources for undocumented students as well, such as their <a href="https://unitedwedream.org/resources/united-we-dream-student-guidebook/">guidebook</a> and a <a href="https://unitedwedream.org/our-work/education-justice/">page</a> with other resources for undocumented students.
